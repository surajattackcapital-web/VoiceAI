*Published: January 2025*

## Introduction

The logistics industry is experiencing a revolutionary transformation powered by Voice AI technology. As supply chains become increasingly complex and customer expectations rise, logistics companies are turning to intelligent voice agents to streamline operations, improve customer service, and reduce costs.

According to recent market research, the AI voice market is valued at **USD 5.2 billion in 2023** and is projected to grow to **USD 26.8 billion by 2032**, with a **20.1% CAGR**. This explosive growth is particularly evident in logistics, where voice AI is solving critical operational challenges.
