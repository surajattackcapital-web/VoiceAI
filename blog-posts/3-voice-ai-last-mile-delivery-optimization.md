# Voice AI for Last-Mile Delivery: Optimizing Customer Communication and Driver Coordination

*Published: January 2025*

## Introduction

Last-mile delivery represents the final and most critical stage of the supply chain, where packages transition from distribution centers to customers' doorsteps. This phase accounts for **53% of total shipping costs** and is often the most challenging part of the delivery process, involving complex coordination between drivers, customers, and logistics systems.

The rise of e-commerce has exponentially increased last-mile delivery complexity, with customers expecting real-time updates, flexible delivery windows, and seamless communication. Traditional phone-based coordination is no longer scalable or efficient enough to meet these demands.

Voice AI is emerging as the game-changing solution for last-mile delivery optimization, enabling intelligent automation of customer communication, driver coordination, and exception handling while maintaining the personal touch that customers value.
